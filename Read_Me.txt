WinSecSentinel: This is a comprehensive security monitoring tool for the Windows operating system.
It provides a user-friendly graphical interface to monitor various aspects of the system's security and to detect potential threats.

The main interface of WinSecSentinel is organized into several tabs, each dedicated to a specific security function:

System Info: Displays basic information about the operating system, machine name, and current user.

Processes: Shows a list of running processes on the system, including their name, process ID, and status.

Anti-Phishing: This feature helps to protect against phishing attacks by allowing the user to scan a URL for potential threats. 
It uses the Google Safe Browsing API to check if a URL is flagged as malicious, and it can detect threats like malware, 
social engineering, unwanted software, and potentially harmful applications.

Ransomware: To combat ransomware, the application employs a "honeypot" strategy. The user can deploy a honeypot,
which is a decoy folder with dummy files that are monitored for any suspicious activity. 
If a process accesses or modifies the files in the honeypot, the application raises an alert, 
as this could be a sign of a ransomware attack. The application can then be configured to take actions like logging off the 
user or isolating the network.

Advanced Monitoring: This section provides more in-depth security monitoring capabilities:

File Integrity: This feature allows the user to create a "baseline" of important files and their checksums.
The application can then periodically check these files for any unauthorized modifications or deletions and will alert the user 
if any changes are detected.

User Accounts: Displays a list of user accounts on the system.

Network Connections: Shows active network connections.

Logs: This tab displays a log of all the activities and alerts generated by the application.

WinSecSentinel also includes the following key components:

Alerting System: The application uses a simple but effective alerting system that displays message boxes with 
different levels of severity: Informational, Warning, and Critical.

Firewall Monitoring: It has the capability to retrieve and display a list of the existing firewall rules.

Customizable Settings: The application's behavior can be configured through the AppSettings.cs file, which allows the user to
set parameters like the monitoring interval, the location of the honeypot, and the directories and registry keys to be monitored.

Futuristic UI: The application has a unique visual style with custom-designed "Futuristic" and "Neon" buttons to enhance the user
experience.

In summary, WinSecSentinel is a multi-layered security tool designed to provide a proactive defense against various cyber threats on a
Windows system. It combines real-time monitoring, threat detection, and a clear alerting system to help users keep their systems secure.
